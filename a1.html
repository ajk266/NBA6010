							Yorango develops SaaS for independent landlords, combining property management tools with tenant search and discovery features.  We empower tenants to find the perfect space while making landlords and property managers more effective and efficient.  Amongst Yorango's offerings are online rent collection, digital document signing and processing, maintenance request management and communications tools, and a portal for prospective tenants to search listings.
						</div>
						<h3> b) </h3>
						<div>
							Monthly subscriptions sold to landlords are the primary revenue source. However, revenue can also be earned by up-selling packages with a la carte services like professional photography, or by allowing site advertising.

						<h3>a)</h3>
						<div>
							Competitors include legacy software providers (e.g. Yardi) with tremendously complex software aimed at large landlords and younger firms offering better UX, but not designing with independent landlords in mind (e.g. Buildium). An inability to engage tenants and a lack of focus on the rental process from end-to-end also hurt these firms. Unlike our competitors, Yorango was purpose-built for the independent landlord, offering them what they need end-to-end without being too complex to be useful.

							<h3>a)</h3>
							y. Lower cost, lower quality, wider access, more automation.
							<br>
							<br>
							Online education allows the beneficial delivery of information to a wide audience at low cost due to the efficiencies gained by information technologies, an advantage of the format. However, there are concerns regarding the quality of education, as there is no physical interaction and peer discussions amongst classmates are restrained by online portals and teleconferencing.
							<h3>b)</h3>

							w. Low quality product is ignored by the competition, and over time as technology improves, it becomes the mainstream product.
							<br>
							<br>
							Disruptive technologies often emerge as minimum viable products, not as fully-furnished tools powerful enough to compete with incumbents on their own. As these MVPs attract a small following, they are able to iterate on their technologies and attract more users.  Over time, these iterations add up into a polished product ready for the mainstream, and disrupting the incumbent.

							<h3>c)</h3>
							Real estate technology is due for a disruption, and recently software companies have taken increasing steps to create more flexible platforms.  In order to respond to this threat, Yorango is focusing on not only marketing existing technologies, but also continuing R&D efforts to increase the flexibility of our tools.
						</div>

							<h2>7.</h2>
							<h3>a)</h3>
							y. The value of a product being proportional to the number of users.
							<br>
							<br/>
							LinkedIn is an example of a network effect business.  As more professionals are on the network, it becomes more valuable to its users who are looking to grow their networks and engage one another.
							<h3> b) </h3>
							z. Yes, especially if the search engine learns from users and improves the product.
							<br>
							<br/>
							Search engines adapting to user queries and behavior are more capable of identifying trends valuable to the user. As such, better results and more targeted advertising can be served, adding value for searchers.
							<h3> c) </h3>
							w. I will bundle my product with a more established product early on, to expose my new product to potential buyers.
							<br>
							<br/>
							This strategy enables firms to easily market a new product to an existing target market. Not only is bundling a strong strategy for earning exposure, it’s also a great way to test market potential and generate network effects from users already familiar with the established product as they try the new tool.
							<h3>d)</h3>
							w. Network effects can increase prices, and prevent innovation because of the monopoly power they confer to some companies.
							<br/>
							<br>
							In the long run, network effects inherently generate monopoly - once everyone is on them, they are harder to leave, allowing the firm to consolidate market share.  If a firm does hold this level of control, it inhibits competition, allowing them to raise prices without substantial risk of disruption, and may lead to a stifling of innovation due to lessened competitive pressures.

							x. There are long delays in achieving productivity, and the average productivity does not reflect the productivity increase in specific businesses.
							<br>
							<br>
							Solow’s argument does not hold because it fails to address the necessary time to appropriately implement information technologies, which defers their impact on productivity. In the long run, overall productivity increases, but not all industries will adapt technology swiftly, effectively and consistently.
							<h3>b)</h3>

							y. Productivity increases have been observed decades after the introduction of a technology, and the volatility in technology sector suggests that average productivity does not reflect individual productivity gains.
							<br>
							<br>
							While technology offers some businesses a competitive advantage, it harms others who cannot appropriately adapt. This turbulence, demonstrated by productivity graphs over the last several decades, is also reflected in the market outcomes for firms falling on either side of this dichotomy.
							<h3>c)</h3>
							z. Network effects can reduce value initially, and consequently increase delays in adoption.
							<br>
							<br>
							At first, network effects inhibit value creation, because in order for their benefit to be realized they need a critical mass of users.  If users do not see others on the platform, they may be hesitant to adopt it until it is more widespread. However, over time, as this critical mass is reached, network effects can greatly enhance the value created by information technologies.

							<h2>11.</h2>
							<h3>a)</h3>
							z. It is a collection of businesses that operate like a single business through coordination.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							By definition, a virtual corporation is a set of businesses that come together via information technology to function as a single entity.  These businesses are able to swiftly form and reform in response to market conditions and other challenges, giving them a high degree of flexibility to meet an array of difficulties under a single banner.
							<h3>b)</h3>
							y. Specialization reduces their operating costs; they incur higher coordination costs; they can respond to opportunities fast; they lose control over some operations.
							<br>
							<br>
							While virtual corporations are can flexibly address a wide variety of opportunities quickly at low operating cost, as there is minimal physical overhead and few barriers to their operation.  However, it is more difficult to coordinate a virtual corporation as people are geographically dispersed and information may not be appropriately distributed. Likewise, it is tough to control the final outcome as operations are not centralized and may be compromised if they cannot function with a high degree of autonomy.

							<h3>c)</h3>
							w. They form consulting teams on the fly from outside the firm, and the teams disband when the project is done.
							<br>
							<br>
							InterSolve calls upon a diverse set of experts for each project they face.  Using information technologies and playing the role of a coordinator, the firm arranges project teams and is able to flexibly respond to client needs.  As projects are finished, teams dissolve to maintain low costs and maximum flexibility.
							<h3>d)</h3>
							By outsourcing programming and sales, Yorango can be converted into a virtual corporation quite easily.  While coordination would be far more difficult, these and other core functions could be delegated effectively without compromising the company’s operations substantially.
