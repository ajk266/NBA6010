						<h2> 4. </h2>

							<h3> a) </h3> Explain how Target determines if someone is pregnant.
						</div>
						<div>

							<div class="bold">
								y. By observing their purchases at Target stores.
							</div>
						</div>

						<div>
							Target aggregates consumer information and purchase histories under Guest IDs, which serve as repositories for this information and inform marketing campaigns highly targeted to individual consumers.  In this case, Target noticed trends in purchase histories corresponding to different trimesters in pregnancies, which allowed the retailer to create a "pregnancy prediction" score useful for advertising to them.
						</div>
						<div class='q'>
							<h3> b) </h3> What is relationship marketing? Why is it easier to do on the web? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>

						<div class="bold">
							z. It involves tracking customers over time, and it is easier to track the process of buying on the web.
						</div>
						<div>

							Relationship marketing focuses on tracking customer needs over time, and using the information acquired to flexibly address their needs.  Assuming the accuracy of data collected, this is far easier to do and much more inexpensive than one-off marketing.  It is easier to do on the web as well, with cookies and similar technologies employed to follow users and better identify their needs, informing marketing efforts.
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> c) </h3> Why is relationship marketing more desirable than mass marketing? Why was mass marketing more desirable in the past? What changed? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>

						<div class="bold">
							x. Tracking an existing customer became cheaper than acquiring a new customer because of the database technology.
						</div>
						<div>
							Relationship marketing is more desirable than mass marketing because it is cheaper and easier and highly useful.  Historically, mass marketing offered both cost and ease advantages, making it preferable.  However, information technologies like databases and cookies not only made this cheaper, but simpler as well as the Internet evolved and commerce increasingly moved online.
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> d) </h3> How can you use relationship marketing in your business to improve customer service?
						</div>
						<div>
							Yorango can use relationship marketing to improve customer service by collecting data about how they engage with the platform and identifying problem areas that are either heavily trafficked or avoided, and providing relevant and timely tips or targeted inquiries to preemptively address concerns (e.g. an unfinished transaction).
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class='pane' id="pane-5">
						<h2> 5. </h2>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> a) </h3> How can online stores exploit the services provided by physical stores? How can physical stores respond? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>

						<div class="bold">
							y. They can utilize the showrooms and sales force of physical stores for physically showing the products, but physical stores can have add on services and charge for them.
						</div>
						<div>
							Showrooming is a major problem for physical stores, especially as online stores gain traction and market share.  Consumers can visit physical stores to learn about products and try them out, but still turn to the Internet to make a purchase.  While physical stores can also develop e-commerce platforms, they’re also able to offer additional services that online offerings cannot match.  These bring in high margins which offset losses to free riding and showrooming.
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> b) </h3> Read the article titled "Google vs Amazon" and explain how Google intends to create an online store? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>

						<div class="bold">
							x. Google intends to make the inventories of all physical stores available online and searchable.
						</div>
						<div>
							Google’s foray into online shopping leverages their core competency in search to give online customers a better way to find retailers and their products, creating value for stores engaging Google’s services for advertising and other functions and cutting into Amazon’s market share.
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> c) </h3>  Explain how you can create synergies between physical and online stores in your business,
							if possible. If not possible, give another example of a business successfully creating
							synergies between online and physical stores.

						</div>
						<div>
							In the real estate space, traditional stores do not exist.  However, properties are inherently "showroomed," a broker’s office can easily be eliminated through information technologies.  After touring a property, all paperwork and payment can be handled online, developing a synergy that lowers costs and increases efficiency for both parties.
						</div>

					</div>

					<div class='pane' id="pane-6">
						<h2>6. </h2>
						<div class='q'>
							<h3> a) </h3>
							Read the article on Culturomics and describe how Google’s Digitized Book database can
							be used to understand historical and cultural trends. Indicate which and briefly explain.

						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								w. By counting the number of references to each subject.
							</p>
							<p>
								Google’s Digitized Book database leverages massive amounts of digitized text to quantify and identify trends,
								using algorithms to track how many references are made throughout the entire body of aggregated text, allowing them to see the
								persistence of historical and cultural phenomena.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='q'>
							<h3> b) </h3>
							Describe how, using the same techniques, Google’s Search Engine Data can be used to make
							predictions about the future. Indicate which and briefly explain.

						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								x. By counting the number of searches for each subject.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as Google Books counts references, which reflect the trends of the time, Google Search can recognize
								trends in what people are looking for, with emergent patterns reflecting interests of the day and implying
								future searches for similar content.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> c) </h3>
							Explain how you can use such historical trends and future predictions in your business strategy, with an example.

						</div>
						<div>
							By tracking historical fluctuations in rent prices and matching them to macroeconomic trends, Yorango can predict future fluctuations and develop smart pricing algorithms for listed properties, similar to Zillow’s Zestimate.
						</div>
						<div class='q'>
							<h3> d) </h3>
							Use Google Ngram Viewer to plot some historical and cultural trends related to your business. For example, you can plot how the relative emphasis on wireless internet and wired internet changed during the last 20 years. Provide a screen shot of your graph on your web page.

							Report on your web page how HSX operates and how you could use this approach to prediction in your business. If you can’t use it, give an example from another business.
						</div>
						<div>
							HSX purchases reflect fans’ interest in new films.  Films attracting trading activity are more popular and thus can be expected to succeed in the box office. Yorango could allow users to “upvote” or “downvote” properties, creating a market based on
							consumer interest, that would allow us to predict the sales prices of apartments reaching the market with similar characteristics.

							<h3> a) </h3>Explain the fundamental tradeoff between inconsistency and information overload in organizational decision-making. How is it related to the centralization-decentralization debate? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								y. Decentralized decisions made at the edges of the organization may lead to inconsistency; centralized decisions made at the center may lead to information overload.
							</p>
							<p>

								Decentralization benefits organizations by limiting information overload, but risks inconsistency of similar decisions are being made in different ways in different parts of the organization, undermining business success.  This suggests centralization may address those concerns. However, centralizing decisions runs the risk of information overload as now all data is consolidated, making it difficult to identify information of value due to the volume thereof.
							</p>

							Do network effects tip the balance towards centralization or decentralization according to Braess’ Paradox? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								w. Network effects favor centralization.
							</p>
							<p>
								Braess argues centralization is necessary in network effect cases to prevent suboptimal outcomes resulting from negative network effects.  Assuming a lack of centralization, the Braess Paradox demonstrates innovative technologies can trigger worse situations as they do not function in sync with one another and may act “selfishly,” infringing on the optimal outcome.
							</p>

							<h3> c) </h3>
							Braess uses highways to demonstrate his paradox. Do highways have network effects? What kind? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								w. Negative but indirect.
							</p>
							<p>
								Highways have indirect negative network effects, because drivers on them, as Braess discusses, will switch routes continuously.  While switching may benefit individual drivers in the short run, the aggregation of switching and traffic redistribution slows down highways overall.

							</p>
						</div>

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> d) </h3>
							Braess argues that wide spread adoption of new and improved technologies may leave everyone worse off. When? Indicate which and briefly explain with an example of that possibility
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								x. When there are network effects and the decisions are decentralized.
							</p>
							<p>
								Decentralized decision-making leads to negative outcomes.  In a weapons example, consider nuclear arms.  When individual countries hold nuclear weapons, they incentivize others to hold arms so as to secure themselves and establish themselves as nuclear powers as well.  However, as more nuclear arms are built, all of human society inches closer to the risk of nuclear holocaust should a war break out.

							Explain the basic tradeoff between market share and market size as it relates to technology
							outsourcing? Indicate which and briefly explain.

						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								y. Outsourcing reduces costs and increases market size; it also eliminates your competitive advantage and reduces your market share.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outsourcing allows swift and cheap development, reducing complexity and enabling industry standards to emerge. However, this also leads to risk of an eroded competitive advantage and reduced market share as technology becomes commoditized.  However, the tradeoff is made because the reduced market share comes with the ability to succeed in a bigger market, albeit a smaller percentage thereof.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='q'>
							<h3> b) </h3>
							Do network effects matter in this tradeoff? How? Indicate which and briefly explain.

						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								x. Network effects favor outsourcing since a larger market size increases the value of the product.
							</p>
							<p>
								Network effects matter in this case, as they are indicative of an industry standard’s emergence, implying a larger market share.  The combination of larger markets and network effects build product value by keeping a high quantity of users on that platform and enhancing market capture, even in the face of the market size-market share tradeoff.

							Explain the difference between the strategies of iPhone and Android phones as of 2010. How is it similar to the Apple vs Microsoft battle in the Microcomputer market of the 1980's? How is it different? Indicate which and briefly explain.
						</div>
						<div>
							<p class="bold">
								z. iPhone tightly controlled hardware design but Android outsourced it; same as Apple vs Microsoft; but unlike Apple of 1980’s iPhone outsourced applications.
							</p>
							<p>
								The iPhone and Android competition in many ways mirrored that between Apple and Microsoft in the 1980s, with Apple controlling hardware aggressively and Android phones outsourced to a number of developers, most notably Samsung and HTC, in an attempt to grow their network.  However, Apple avoided their fatal mistake in the 1980s by outsourcing application development, betting that the vast selection of apps are a key component of the iPhone’s competitive advantage, a strategy that has proven highly successful and enabled the firm to not only grow the market, but also capture market share.

						<div class='q'>
							<h3> d) </h3>
							What part of your business can you outsource safely? Will it impact your market share?
							Will it increase the overall market size?

						</div>
						<div>
							We can safely outsource listings on Yorango, allowing others to post them instead of adding them ourselves.  While we risk being seen as a commodity listing site like Craigslist, which could impact market share, we also are able to grow the market and can carve out a niche of a more sizeable space.
